# Wind Waker Awesome Edition

Bringing a new version of shitty texture packs to your Dolphin Emulator!


## Wow I saw your project and really want to spend my useful time contributing, how do I do so?

Are you good at making really bad drawings? Then hey! Guess what? This project is perfect for you. There is absolutely no quality control here.

1. Dump textures via Dolphin (Graphics -> Advanced -> Dump Textures)
2. Find a texture you want to make a bad version of.
3. Make sure the texture isn't already re-drawn (just do a quick search in the folder for the filename).
4. If the texture you chose isn't re-drawn, feel free to make a bad re-drawn version.
5. Make sure the filename of the re-drawn texture is the same as the original.
6. Now just make a pull request.
