# Contribution Guide

Contributing is pretty straightforward , just find a texture that hasn't doesn't have a bad version of it (search the filename first for matches in the repo).

### Try to make it interesting
It's not mandatory, but try and be interesting with how terrible you can make the textures.

### Don't put hateful things in the textures
This should be obvious. Anything racist, etc won't be accepted. 

### Keep the memes fresh if possible
Self-explanatory. You don't directly give guests rotten food to eat – at least try and disguise it first.

### Too much of one thing isn't always a good thing.
Everyone loves the whacky Kappa face, but pasting it in every texture makes things boring – the same goes for anything else.


### Most importantly, have fun
